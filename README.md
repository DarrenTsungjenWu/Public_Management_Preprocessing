# Public_Management Project
Public Management PPP Research in China------Nanjing University, China


This file is briefings of this project indicating the contents in this Github repository where (1) 5 datasets (all xlsx files in the repository); (2) a data preprocessing codes file; and (3) a sheet of final report.

For a quick introduction to this project, here we also drop some summary of concept. 

The report aims to research the factors which have ability to affect "Launch Rate" of PPP (Public-Private Partnership Project) Environmental Projects in China as a whole. 

The term Launch Rate (originally it comes from Chinese 落地率) is translated from an official document (http://www.catl.org.cn/2017-03/17/content_40498347.htm), whilst this technical term, in our final report, has never actually been used as there is currently no English version of this report, neither summaries nor whole contexts.

The final report covers scope of project, background introduction, data collection, data preprocessing (technically see public_management_dt_process.txt), research design, quantitative models (precisely, Logistic Regression) as well as conclusions. 

Noteworthily, the final report is Darren's (吳宗仁) version. 

There are 3 other respective versions from another contributed mutual authors: 饒釗，劉婧，劉星月, while these versions are not available at this sites.
